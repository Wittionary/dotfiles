# - Run dos2unix to ensure CRLF is converted to LF
# - Manually copy this file on top of /etc/wsl.conf
# - `wsl --shutdown` to restart WSL

# Network host settings that enable the DNS server used by WSL 2.
# This example changes the hostname, sets generateHosts to false, preventing WSL from the default behavior of auto-generating /etc/hosts,
# and sets generateResolvConf to false, preventing WSL from auto-generating /etc/resolv.conf, so that you can create your own (ie. nameserver 1.1.1.1).

# Set a command to run when a new WSL instance launches. This example starts the Docker container service.
